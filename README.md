# Hotel-Booking-Demand-Project
This dataset contains the information about hotel bookings of different hotel types and other parameters such as lengths of stays, guest's special request, deposit types, meal types, number of guests, etc,..
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis and data visualization to understand the meaningful estimators within the dataset and ultimately build a model to predict the hotel booking cancellation rate. The best model can be used for hotel owners and staffs to plan accordingly to reduce the cancellation rate and increase their revenues.
